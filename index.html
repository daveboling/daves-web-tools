		 <p>Hello and welcome to this Github page and/or website. <br /><br/>
			The goal of my web dev tools is to teach very very new developers modern front-end web development skills by example. <br/> <br/>
			So, with that being said. If I feel like something is too complex or <em>mysterious</em>, I will comment the tutorial right next to the code. That's right, no pretty drafted-up typography with a nicely designed page. (Sorry designers)</p>

			<p>In that last paragraph, you'll notice an emphasis on <em>mysterious</em>. Let me first state that I am also a newbie programmer, you may find many mistakes that are not considered semantic or modern, but they accomplish the same thing. Keep that dully noted.

			With that being said, in programming a lot of things just 'work'. As a person with a background in C++ and programming in general, <em>mysteries</em> drive me NUTS. 80% of my time is spent understanding code, the other 20% is writing. I want you to understand too.</p>

			<p class="noMysteries">Henceforth...</p>

			<p class="noMysteries">...the catchphrase 'No mysteries!' will be drilled in your head!</p>

			<p class="noMysteries">Let's get to it y'all.</p>
